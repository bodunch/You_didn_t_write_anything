# You didn`t write anything

## Idea:
It all started when I saw a meme with a man writing something on a piece of paper, and the paper was burning. So I started and finished working on this project in one evening.

## Implementation:
The application is built in a single class because I was too lazy to build the architecture, lol.
But at the same time, I tried to avoid all exceptional cases so that the application would work at least a little bit stably.

But if you review my code, I won't mind.

## App functionality:

key shortcuts:  ESCAPE - clear all
                SHIFT + ESCAPE - back to main menu
                SHIFT + BACKSPACE - go out

You need to enter the number of words that will be displayed on the screen.

To start the program, enter T; if not, enter F.
